This is where an active list of performers, musicians, artists, and spiritual leaders who have received votes from the [telegram group, One Love Fest][0], to attend the 2018 One Love Fest in Lake Perris, Califonia November 2-4th. We are developing a voting bot that will welcome new users to the group and show them how to vote right in the telegram group on who they want to see at the 2018 One Love Fest.

This helps the organizers of the festival focus their resources towards building a relationship with the most desired creatives and their fans. Plus it will allow fans to build up demand and a community to support these inspiring people within the One Love Eco.
